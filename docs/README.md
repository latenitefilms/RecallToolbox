Recall Toolbox is a **Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension** that acts as a Shared Pasteboard.

**Anything that you can copy and paste in Final Cut Pro, Recall Toolbox can store.**

### Build for Final Cut Pro

There are also other third party tools like the amazing [Copy 'Em ​(for Mac)](https://apprywhere.com/ce-mac.html), but again, it's not quite as visual, and it's not built from the ground up for Final Cut Pro users.

Recall Toolbox works as a Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension, so it's window position gets saved with your custom Workspaces.

Whilst [CommandPost](https://commandpost.io) has had a Shared Pasteboard & Pasteboard Buffers for years, it's really optimised for Control Surfaces. You can access the Shared Pasteboard from the menubar, and it is super powerful, but it's not as visual, as a nice Pasteboard Browser.

### iCloud Sync

Recall Toolbox automatically syncs to ALL your devices on the same iCloud account automagically!

---

### iCloud Sharing

You can share folders with other iCloud users, and control permissions. For example, you could have a "read only" folder that contains client logos for a current job!
